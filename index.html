					Originally, I pictured a Google Slides presentation to show some of my freelance work.<br>
					I came to realize that idea was just ok and wasn't a challenge or learning experience.<br>
					<br>
					I decided should have something better.

					Research time...

					<p>In the midst of that research...<p>
					<p>I started to explore and learn GitHub.<p>
					<p>That lead to the discovery of reveal.js.<p>
					<p>If you're not familiar, <a href="https://revealjs.com/" target="_blank">"reveal.js is an open source HTML presentation framework"</a>.<p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					So, I decided to create this presentation using reveal.js hosted on GitHub pages.<br>
					<br>
					I started with one of the included themes, modified the .CSS file, coded the individual slides, and voila!

					As you can tell by the address and the nice blue popup in the footer, this site is hosted on Weebly.<br>
					It is quite possible to create a very nice and relevant sit here.<br>
					However...

					During my aforementioned research, I realized WordPress is more relevant and knowing WordPress could be beneficial to my career.<br>
					I am currently working on a WordPress site that I plan to launch sometime in May.
