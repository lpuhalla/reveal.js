					<p>I found, began to explore, and started learning GitHub.<p>

					<p>If you're not familiar, <a href="https://revealjs.com/" target="_blank">"reveal.js is an open source HTML presentation framework"</a>.<p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-transition="concave">
					So, I decided to create this presentation using reveal.js hosted on GitHub pages.<br>

					I started with one of the included themes, modified the .CSS file, coded the individual slides, and voila!

					I discovered I enjoyed processing the data to find the story it contained.<br>
