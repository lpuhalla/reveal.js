					Originally, I pictured a Google Slides presentation to show some of my freelance work.<br>
					I came to realize that idea was just ok and wasn't a challenge or learning experience.<br>
					<br>
					I started to look for something better.

					<p>In the midst of that research...<p>
					<p>I began to explore and learn GitHub.<p>
					<p>That lead to the discovery of reveal.js.<p>
					<p>If you're not familiar, <a href="https://revealjs.com/" target="_blank">"reveal.js is an open source HTML presentation framework"</a>.<p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					So, I decided to create this presentation using reveal.js hosted on GitHub pages.<br>
					<br>
					I started with one of the included themes, modified the .CSS file, coded the individual slides, and voila!
				</section>
				
				<section>
					As you can tell by the address and the nice blue popup in the footer, this site is hosted on Weebly.<br>
					It is entirely possible to create a very nice and relevant site here.<br>
					<br>
					However...

				<section>
					I realized WordPress is more relevant and knowing WordPress could a potential benefit to my career.<br>
					I am currently working on a WordPress site that I plan to launch sometime in the near future.
				</section>
				
				<section>
					Now, back to my original thought.<br>
					The following slides are to show some of my freelance work.
