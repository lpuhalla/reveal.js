					I decided should have something better.

					I realized Wordpress is much more relevant, definitely a challenge, and would be a great learning experience.<br>
					About that same time, I started exploring GitHub which led to my discovery of GitHub pages and reveal.js.

					I took one of the included themes, modified the .CSS file, coded the individual slides, and voila!
